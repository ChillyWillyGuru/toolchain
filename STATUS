The current status of the toolchain and libraries  is ALPHA.  
I have compiled and ran the samples in the psl1ght samples directory  
and they all appear to work.  
  
Neither of the games from the PS3 version of the Enlightenment Foundation Library  
work completely.  Eskiss compiles and will display the title screen.  If you try going  
into anything (ie, level editor, play game, etc), it will lock.  I am looking into this.  
  
I have currently only tried one homebrew program outside of the samples provided (PSChannel).  
It does depend on the ps3efl library.  It will open successfully and you can move around  
the various options, however, if you try clicking something, it doesn't do anything.  
Once I figure the problems out with EFL, I have a feeling PSChannel will work.  
  
If anyone finds some homebrew that compiles and runs successfully, please e-mail  
me at SporkSchivago@gmail.com to let me know.  Thank you.
