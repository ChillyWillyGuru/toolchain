The current status of the toolchain and libraries  is ALPHA.
I have compiled and ran the samples in the psl1ght samples directory
and they all appear to work.

Neither of the games from the PS3 version of the Enlightenment Foundation Library
seem to work.  I am looking into this.

I have currently only tried one homebrew program outside of the samples provided and
it failed.  It does depend on the ps3efl library.  Once I figure the problems out
with EFL, I have a feeling the homebrew will work.

If anyone finds some homebrew that compiles and runs successfully, please e-mail
me at nacho2874@yahoo.com to let me know.  Thank you.
