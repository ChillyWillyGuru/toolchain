I couldn't of gotten this far if it was not for the great people on the fontconfig, cairo, curl, and the tiff
mailing list along with some of the PS3 developers answering a lot of my questions.  Also, my fiancee, Jessica
for putting up with me staying up real late and spending most of my time on my desktop.
